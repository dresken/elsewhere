URL Shortener and redirection service
Lifetime (from to, expiry on no use (bots?), expiry on low use)
Path Generation:
    Random
    FIOA
    Stated
    Deakin Hosted domain vs anywhere
Destination monitoring (HTML title, return status (404, 302, 500))
Groups for permissions – hmm
Multi domained – two domains can point to the same redirection set.

Redirection types:
    Status Codes: 302, 301 etc
    Pause page with link and javascript redirect (CSSable per domain with default)
    Static page with link (CSSable per domain with default)
    Lifecyle management (see lifetime options)
Matching
    starts with and exact
    Append extra path, append query string, report, etc

Issues with redirector:
    DB reliant
        loader to load onto box
        Hit – should return to client and continue to run in background
        Monitor apache logs – instead of php hit
    Squiz – can't rely on paths not existing
        .htaccess
        F5 loader
